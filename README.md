The file `h_star_vecs` contains a list of the 14373 distinct $h^\ast$-vectors that occur for 4-dimensional reflexive polytopes (of which there are 473800776), and the number of occurrences for each. The data is in text format: a line containing the five coordinates of the $h^\ast$-vector is followed by a line with the respective count. 

This computation was originally carried out to answer a [MathOverflow question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/503719/how-many-distinct-ehrhart-polynomials-for-reflexive-polytopes) by Frédéric Chapoton, the result is being uploaded for reference. (It was subsequently realized that a similar computation has been done by [Volker Braun](https://doi.org/10.1142/9789814412551_0010), unfortunately, their data appears to be unavailable.)

The output was generated using the Julia code in `generate.jl`, which relies on the packages [Oscar.jl](https://www.oscar-system.org) and [Polymake.jl](https://oscar-system.github.io/Polymake.jl/stable/), as well as the [polyDB](https://polydb.org) database. The latter makes use of the original classification of 4-dimensional reflexive polytopes by [M. Kreuzer and H. Skarke](https://dx.doi.org/10.4310/ATMP.2000.v4.n6.a2), but has the advantage of various properties, including $h^\ast$-vectors, already being stored in the database. This allows for the computation to run in just a few hours. Thanks go to Benjamin Lorenz for helpful advice.
